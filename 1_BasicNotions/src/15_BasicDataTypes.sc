//Unit is a subtype of scala.AnyVal.
// There is only one value of type Unit, (), and it is not represented by any object
// in the underlying runtime system.
// A method with return type Unit is analogous to a Java method which is declared void.
val noValue: Unit = ()


//Null is a trait whose single instance is null
val nullValue : Null = null //null or empty reference

//Nothing is The subtype of every other type; includes no values
// It is characterized by two properties:
// Nothing is a subtype of every other type (including Null).
//  There exist no instances of this type.
//One other use of Nothing is as a return type for methods that never return.
//It makes sense if you think about it. If a methodâ€™s return type is Nothing, and there exists absolutely no instance of Nothing, then such a method must never return.
//val notin : Nothing   // this one cannot be instatiated
//notin.isInstanceOf[String] // should have been true (if an instance could have been created)

//While Nothing is a subtype of everything, it does not inherit
// any method except for those in Any. This is because Nothing is more geared
// toward the functional end of the language. It's necessary for things like Option and List, but only as a type, not as a class.

//Any is the supertype of the entire scala system
val any: Any = 234

//AnyRef is the supertype of any reference type
